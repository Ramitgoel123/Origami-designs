         <p> SOME INTERESTING FACTS ABOUT CAMEL -- <br>
            A camel is an even-toed ungulate in the genus Camelus that bears distinctive fatty deposits known as "humps" on its back. <br> Camels have long been domesticated and, as livestock, they provide food (milk and meat) and textiles (fiber and felt from hair). <br> Camels are working animals especially suited to their desert habitat and are a vital means of transport for passengers and cargo. <br> There are three surviving species of camel. <br> The one-humped dromedary makes up 94% of the world's camel population, and the two-humped Bactrian camel makes up 6%. <br> The Wild Bactrian camel is a separate species and is now critically endangered.

         <p> SOME INTERESTING FACTS ABOUT CHAMELEON -- <br>
            Chameleons are a distinctive and highly specialized clade of Old World lizards with 202 species described as of June 2015. <br> These species come in a range of colors, and many species have the ability to change color.<br>

            Chameleons are distinguished by their zygodactylous feet; their swaying gait; and crests or horns on their brow and snout. <br> Most species, the larger ones in particular, also have a prehensile tail. <br> Chameleons' eyes are independently mobile, but in aiming at a prey item, they focus forward in coordination, affording the animal stereoscopic vision.<br>
            
            Chameleons are adapted for climbing and visual hunting. <br> They live in warm habitats that range from rainforest to desert conditions, with various species occurring in Africa, Madagascar, southern Europe, and across southern Asia as far as Sri Lanka. <br> They have been introduced to Hawaii, California, and Florida.

         <p> SOME INTERESTING FACTS ABOUT CICADA -- <br>
            The cicadas are a superfamily, the Cicadoidea, of insects in the order Hemiptera (true bugs). <br> They are in the suborder Auchenorrhyncha, along with smaller jumping bugs such as leafhoppers and froghoppers. <br> The superfamily is divided into two families, Tettigarctidae, with two species in Australia, and Cicadidae, with more than 3,000 species described from around the world. <br> Many species remain undescribed.<br>

            Cicadas have prominent eyes set wide apart, short antennae, and membranous front wings. <br> They have an exceptionally loud song, produced in most species by the rapid buckling and unbuckling of drumlike tymbals. <br> The earliest known fossil Cicadomorpha appeared in the Upper Permian period; extant species occur all around the world in temperate to tropical climates. <br> They typically live in trees, feeding on watery sap from xylem tissue and laying their eggs in a slit in the bark. <br> Most cicadas are cryptic. The vast majority of species are active during the day as adults, with some calling at dawn or dusk. <br> Only a rare few species are known to be nocturnal.

         <p> SOME INTERESTING FACTS ABOUT GAINT PANDA -- <br>
            The giant panda also known as the panda bear(or simply the panda), is a bear native to South Central China. <br> It is characterised by its bold black-and-white coat and rotund body. <br> The name "giant panda" is sometimes used to distinguish it from the red panda, a neighboring musteloid. <br> Though it belongs to the order Carnivora, the giant panda is a folivore, with bamboo shoots and leaves making up more than 99% of its diet. <br> Giant pandas in the wild will occasionally eat other grasses, wild tubers, or even meat in the form of birds, rodents, or carrion. <br> In captivity, they may receive honey, eggs, fish, yams, shrub leaves, oranges, or bananas along with specially prepared food.

            Pigeons have made contributions of considerable importance to humanity, especially in times of war.<br> In war the homing ability of pigeons has been put to use by making them messengers. <br> So-called war pigeons have carried many vital messages and some have been decorated for their services. <br>Medals such as the Croix de Guerre, have been awarded to pigeons for their services in saving human lives.
